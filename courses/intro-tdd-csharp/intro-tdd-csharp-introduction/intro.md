# Introduction

Developing software is an art. An art of where the developer pick up ideas and put them in code, to create an solution to particular challenge. There are many strategies to develop code, but in order to control the quality of the solution, we need to control de quality of the functionalities and what the code is expected to do.

Usually, developers (that) write tests after implementing the code. And therefor, the tests are driven by that implementation of the code. This approach is error prone, and are not focused on the use cases coverage, but rather to code coverage.

Test Driven Development, is another **software development** approach, where we start the development by creating the tests that will cover the use cases, what are the case expectations and afterward develop the code that will implement the given behavior. With this approach, all the code that you develop, all the use cases that is implemented, will be covered by tests.

# Module Description

Within this module we cover the following subjects:
1. Basic solution structure.
1. The libraries that we'll need to develop the unit tests.
1. A simple example of an unit test.
